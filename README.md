# Lightning Jet 🚀⚡️, or simply Jet

Lightning Jet is a fully automated rebalancer for nodes on the [Lightning Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Network). Jet facilitates routing by moving channel liquidity to where its needed the most, taking into account routing volume, missed routing opportunities (htlcs), and a variety of other factors.

Jet runs as a daemon (background service) on a broad range of [supported platforms](#supported-platforms). It categorizes peers into inbound and outbound based on routing volume; it then rebalances the channels (via circular rebalancing), ensuring sufficient liquidity (inbound and outbound) for bi-directional routing.

Lightning Jet's mission is to assist independent node operators in competing in the ever-changing landscape of the Lightning Network as large institutional players enter the space.

## Supported Platforms

You can [install Lightning Jet](#prerequisites) on a laptop, desktop, Raspberry Pi, RaspiBlitz, myNode and other platforms.

You can use Lightning Jet to rebalance your node in [Voltage Cloud](#voltage-cloud). In this setup, Jet will connect to your node remotely via a secure connection.

You can install and run Lightning Jet in [Docker](#docker) (for advanced users with prior Docker experience).

Jet is available on [EmbassyOS](https://github.com/Start9Labs/embassy-os) and can rebalance channels on [Start9](https://start9.com/latest/) products that run the OS.

Jet can be installed in [Ubuntu VM](#ubuntu-vm) on Windows, Mac OS, and other platforms.

## Prerequisites

Make sure to [install node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't have it already. Run `node -v` to check if you have `node` and whether it is up to date (version 16.x+). Update `node` in case of an old version (this will also update `npm`).

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

> The above command updates node binaries. Alternatively, you can [download an installable](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for your platform.

Make sure `npm` is up to date (version 8.x) by running `npm -v`. Update `npm` in case of an old version; refer to `node` update steps above.

> You may run into an issue of having multiple copies of `npm` installed if you update `npm` separately from `node`. Re-run `npm -v` after the update to ensure that your path is picking the update version. You can locate multiple copies by `find / -name npm 2> /dev/null`; identify the right copy of `npm` and update `PATH` in `~/.profile` accordingly.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itsneski/lightning-jet
cd lightning-jet
npm install
nano ./api/config.json
```
Edit `config.json`: set correct absolute (not relative) paths for `macaroonPath` and `tlsCertPath`. On umbrel, macaroons are typically located at `/home/umbrel/umbrel/lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/admin.macaroon`, tls cert is at `/home/umbrel/umbrel/lnd/tls.cert`.

> On umbrel0.5.0+, macaroons are located at `/home/umbrel/umbrel/app-data/lightning/data/lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/admin.macaroon` and tls cert at `/home/umbrel/umbrel/app-data/lightning/data/lnd/tls.cert`.

```bash
nano ~/.profile
```
Edit `.profile`: add a prefix `$HOME/lightning-jet:` to the line that says `export PATH=`. The line should look like this:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/lightning-jet:<rest of your path, leave it as is>"
```
Add `export PATH=$HOME/lightning-jet:$PATH` to the end of `.profile` if the line does not exist.

Next, execute the updated `.profile` for your current terminal session. The path will be set automatically for all new sessions.
```bash
. ~/.profile
```
Test your path by running `jet -v`. Your path is set correctly if it prints out help. Fix the `PATH` in `~/.profile` in case of an error.

#### Upgrade to Umbrel0.5.0 (Umbrel5)

Umbrel5 changed the location of macaroons and tls cert files. Edit config file to set correct paths for macaroons at `/home/umbrel/umbrel/app-data/lightning/data/lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/admin.macaroon` and tls cert at `/home/umbrel/umbrel/app-data/lightning/data/lnd/tls.cert`.

```bash
nano ./api/config.json
```

#### RaspiBlitz

- Install JET (following the [above steps](#node-and-npm)) 
- Set the following in `config.json`:
```
"macaroonPath": "/home/bos/.lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/admin.macaroon"
"tlsCertPath": "/home/bos/.lnd/tls.cert"
```

The following step may not be necessary in case you get read access to channel.db via a symlink.

```bash
chmod +r /home/bos/.lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/admin.macaroon
```

## Post-Installation

```shell
jet start daddy
```

## How to run

```shell
jet help
```

#### Examples:
|||
|--|--|
|`jet peers`|Lists peers classified into inbound, outbound, and low-volume based on htlc history. Notable columns: `p` - % of [inbound or outbound] routing by the peer out of a total [inbound or outbound] across all peers; `ppm` - peer's current ppm rate; `margin` - rebalance will be profitable as long as its ppm is below the margin.|
|`jet monitor`|Monitors ongoing rebalances, rebalance history, and stuck htlcs. Warns about the state of BOLT database (channel.db); for example, jet will warn when the channel.db grows over a threshold.|
|`jet monitor --status`|Monitors the status of rebalances; shows whether rebalances are paused or active; provides recommendation for local ppm range.|
|`jet stats`|Displays profitability metrics over a time period, including delta(s) with previous time period. Node operators can use this tool to A/B test new channels and fee updates on existing channels.|

## Docker

This installation is for advanced users with prior Docker experiece. Refer [here](#prerequisites) for a host-based installation on a laptop, desktop, Raspberry Pi, RaspiBlitz, myNode and other platforms.

### Prerequisites

- [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if not exists (`docker -v`)
- [Install docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) if not exists (`docker-compose -v`)
- Add user id to the docker group; run `id` to see if its in the group

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itsneski/lightning-jet
cd lightning-jet
. docker/genconfig.sh
```

Edit `$HOME/.lightning-jet/config.json`: set correct paths for `macaroonPath` and `tlsCertPath`. On Umbrel, macaroons are located at `/home/umbrel/umbrel/lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/admin.macaroon`, tls cert is at `/home/umbrel/umbrel/lnd/tls.cert`. Optional: list expensive nodes to avoid in the `avoid` section.

```bash
nano $HOME/.lightning-jet/config.json
```

Edit the `docker/.env`: set `LND_DIR` to your installation of LND (typically `/home/umbrel/umbrel/lnd`). Set `LND_HOSTNAME` and `LND_IP_ADDRESS` to match your instance of LND. On Umbrel you can leave default `LND_HOSTNAME`. For `LND_IP_ADDRESS` run `ifconfig -a | grep inet` then select IP address that begins with `10.`. Make sure that `LND_CONFIG_FILE` path is correct.

```bash
nano docker/.env
```

### Build image

```bash
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml build
```
This make take a while, make sure not to interrupt the process.

### Start up daddy

```shell
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
```

### Execute commands

Prepend [all commands](#how-to-run) with `docker exec -it lightning-jet`:
```shell
docker exec -it lightning-jet jet help
```

## Ubuntu VM

Lightning Jet can be installed in Ubuntu VM on Windows, Mac OS, and other platforms.

1. [Install VirtualBox and set up Ubuntu image](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox#1-overview)

2. [Add user to the sudo group](https://www.tecmint.com/fix-user-is-not-in-the-sudoers-file-the-incident-will-be-reported-ubuntu/)

3. Install curl: `sudo snap install curl`

4. [Install node](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions/blob/master/README.md#using-ubuntu)

5. Install git: `sudo apt install git`

6. [Install jet](#installation)

7. Copy over admin.macaroon (and tls.cert if needed) as in [Voltage Cloud](#voltage-cloud)

## Voltage Cloud

Lightning Jet can rebalance your node in Voltage Cloud by connecting to it remotely via a secure grpc connection. You can select any platform (host-based or cloud, like AWS) to install Jet as long as it supports [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Jet runs as a daemon (background process), so its best to select a platform that supports running Jet 24/7.

1. Download `admin.macaroon` from Voltage Cloud, the option is visible on the front page when you log into the dashboard. Remember the location where you downloaded the file.

2. [Install Jet](#prerequisites), skip the section that edits `config.json`. Run `jet -v` to ensure you get a valid response.

3. Create a folder under lightning-jet, say `voltage`, and move `admin.macaroon` there. This will ensure that the macaroon file won't get accidentally deleted.

Next, update `config.json` by `nano api/config.json`:

1. Set `macaroonPath` to the absolute (not relative) path of `admin.macaroon` file from the previous step, e.g. `/home/umbrel/lightning-jet/voltage/admin.macaroon` if on umbrel.

2. Remove `tlsCertPath` from the config.

3. Add `serverAddress` to config that points at API Endpoint, you can find it on the front page of Voltage Cloud dashboard. The value should be in the following format: `<node alias>.m.voltageapp.io:10009`.

Example of config file:

```json
{
  "avoid": [
  ],
  "macaroonPath": "/home/umbrel/lightning-jet/voltage/admin.macaroon",
  "serverAddress": "<node alias>.m.voltageapp.io:10009",
  "debugMode": false,
  "rebalancer": {
    "maxTime": 30,
    "maxPpm": 650,
    "maxAutoPpm": 500,
    "maxInstances": 40,
    "maxPendingHtlcs": 4,
    "enforceMaxPpm": false,
    "exclude": [
    ]
  }
}
```

Run `jet peers` once installation is completed and ensure you get a correct answer as opposed to an error. `jet start daddy` to kick off Jet's automated rebalancer.

## Telegram bot
Lightning Jet telegram bot (jet bot) will notify you about important events such as changes in fees for your remote peers.

To create jet bot: initiate a conversation with [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot) on your Telegram app. Then, select the bot's name (e.g., JET bot) and bot's username (e.g., JET_bot).

Copy the telegram token from the Telegram app chat with BotFather (right under 'Use this token to access the HTTP API:'). `nano ./api/config.json` to add the `telegramToken` setting with the above value (see config file example below).

`jet start telegram` to kick off the service. Make sure there are no errors. Then open a chat with the bot you just created in your Telegram app and type `/start`. This will kick off the communication between the Telegram bot with Jet. You only need to do this step once.

> Make sure to restart the telegram service if it was already running prior to updating the config file: `jet restart telegram`.

## Config file
A list of config settings under `./api/config.json`:
|||
|--|--|
|`macaroonPath`|`admin.macaroon` absolute path for Jet connect to LND.|
|`tlsCertPath`|tls cert absolute path for Jet connect to LND.|
|`serverAddress`|server address and port number of lnd host; defaults to localhost:10009.|
|`telegramToken`|The telegram bot token.|
|`avoid`|A list of nodes to avoid during manual and automated rebalances. `jet rebalance` avoids expensive nodes automatically. the `avoid` setting can help speed things up by providing a static list of nodes to avoid.|

Settings under `rebalancer` section:
|||
|--|--|
|`maxPpm`|Maximum ppm for manual rebalances.|
|`maxAutoPpm`|Maximum ppm for automated rebalances. This setting is typically lower than `maxPpm` since automated rebalances can spend more time looking for a cheaper route than manual rebalances.|
|`maxTime`|Timeout rebalance after N minutes. This setting can be overridden by `jet rebalance --mins` parameter for manual rebalances.|
|`maxInstances`|Maximum rebalance instances that the auto rebalancer can launch. Keep this setting lower if your node gets overloaded (e.g., monitor by `top` command).|
|`maxPendingHtlcs`|Maximum number of pending htlcs that a peer can have for circular rebalance. Rebalance will be skipped otherwise.|
|`enforceMaxPpm`|Controls whether jet will enforce max ppm default set by `maxAutoPpm` for all rebalances. By default, as long as rebalances are still profitable, jet may override the default max ppm with [outbound] peer's local ppm. With `enforceMaxPpm` set to `true` jet will cap the rebalances by`maxAutoPpm`. The downside is that it may reduce the rebalance success rate for peers with local ppm being higher than the default max ppm.|
|`enforceProfitability`|When set to true, jet will pause all non profitable automated rebalances, leaving only profitable rebalances. Monitor rebalance status by `jet monitor --status`|
|`minCapacity`|Sets minimum capacity (in sats) for channels to be included in automated rebalancing. For example, `"minCapacity": 500000` means that channels with capacity below or equal to `500000` sats will be excluded from automated rebalancing.|
|`buffer`|Minimum rebalance buffer in sats, overrides default value of `250`. Jet will warn when the delta between local and remote ppm for outbound and balanced peers is below the buffer.|
|`disabled`|When set to true, the setting disables automated rebalancer. You can still rebalance manually via `jet rebalance`. Requires restart of the daddy service `jet restart daddy` followed by `jet stop rebalancer`.|
|`exclude`|A list of nodes to exclude from auto rebalancing. In terms of terminology, rebalance A -> B means that liquidity is moving from the local side of channel [with peer] A to the local side of channel with B. "exclude": ["A:from", "B:to", "C:all"] ensures that A won't be rebalanced from, B won't be rebalanced into, and C won't participate in the rebalancing at all. p.s. previous "A:inbound" is equivalent to "A:from", and "B:outbound" is equivalent to "B:to".|
